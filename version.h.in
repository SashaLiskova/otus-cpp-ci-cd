    this file is template file and cmake configures it, by setting
   PROJECT_VERSION_PATCH if I will change the value to non cmake defined value
   like @non@ -> it will be defined, but empty -> #define PROJECT_VERSION_PATCH

   funny moment with comments: if i will write cmakedefine with # in the
   begginging, and some non cmake stuff, cmake will try to comment it with / *
   -> witch created for me neste / * and caused mistake, co cmake goes through
   what is in comments

    note: format on save I have adds expta space before clothing @, CTRL +K S ->
    saves without formatiing, but good to add such thing for formatter (if
    ossible)

/*
    cmakedefine is define from cmake, if i delete project(..) line from cmake,
    this line will be commented in version.h file
